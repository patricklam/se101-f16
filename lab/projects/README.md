## Rock-Paper-Scissors (Project\_RPS)
Mini-game emulating rock-paper-scissors. You should peek at Wire\_Util.ino. It might inspire some useful ways to abstract away I2C communication, making it simpler to work with the chips/EEPROM on the Orbit Booster pack!

Components Used:
 - Accelerometer for shake detection.
 - OLED Screen and button for user interface.
