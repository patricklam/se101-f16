# SE 101 Week 2: How to Student

## Course Syllabi

The syllabus works like a contract between the instructor and the
class about how the class is going to be run. Key parts of a syllabus
include:

* instructor contact info (when, where, how)
* list of topics
* grading scheme and due dates

In the future, you will have electives. Syllabi can help you decide whether
to take a particular elective or not (e.g. by evaluating the workload and
what you'll get out of it).

### How universities work ($$$)

The University of Waterloo's income for 2015/16 shows total income of $646MM;
$225MM is grants and $358MM is tuition (so about half). Expenses of $466MM on
salary and benefits (thanks!) and $46MM on student support.

In Canada, provincial governments are responsible for directly funding
education.  Ontario's grant to the University of Waterloo dropped by
$1,684 per student between 1995 and
2001. (http://policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/Ontario_Office_Pubs/university_funding_cuts.pdf)

### How the SE programme works

Software Engineering is jointly offered by the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science 
and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

We have strong support from both CS and ECE, but we are not independent; we exist because of
the cooperation between these units. This is not obvious to students, so that it's not so
different to be an SE student rather than a CE student, but we don't have e.g. final say over
hiring new faculty, or over space; we need to get buy-in from both CS and ECE for such changes.

### How many SE students graduate

Recently, between 80 and 100. In upcoming years, around 120. Outlier:
class of 2018 = 151 admits, currently 145 students.

### How grades work in Waterloo Engineering

In terms of term promotion decisions, we follow Engineering rules. 50% is a pass in a
course, but you need a term average of 59.5% to pass the term.

### How SE students work after graduation

From the class of 2015: 

* Where? 10% Waterloo, 8% Ontario ex-Waterloo, 2% Canada ex-Ontario, 60% USA, 20% unknown

* PEng anticipated? Yes = 4%, no = 56%, unknown = 42%

* Next step? 80% full-time engineering; 6% full-time non-engineering; 6% grad school

* Starting Salary? US = $110k, Canada = $70k

* Would recommend SE? 46% strongly agree, 50% agree, 2% neutral, 4% disagree
