# SE 101 In-Class Quiz 8
## November 29, 2016

This quiz is open-book. In fact you can even (quietly) talk to your neighbour about it. 
Please write a brief paragraph for each question.

### Question 1: What are two examples of how a standard has helped you today (different domains, e.g. not both software)?

### Question 2: What is an unintended consequence of the robustness principle?

### Question 3 (3 points): Write down a calculation which either affirms or debunks San Murugesan's claim: "... the energy savings are well worth the inconvenience of waiting a short time for a computer to reboot or a peripheral to come online."
